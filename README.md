▎Project Outline: Modeling Inventory Transactions and Movement

▎Objective:

To develop an inventory management system that accurately tracks inventory transactions and movements, ensuring real-time visibility of stock levels across various locations. The system will handle receiving, transferring, selling, and adjusting inventory, providing a reliable way to manage stock.

---

▎Project Description:

This project aims to create a user-friendly inventory management system that can handle various types of transactions related to inventory. Users will be able to record incoming stock from suppliers, manage sales to customers, transfer items between warehouses or stores, and adjust stock levels for discrepancies. The system will ensure that all movements are logged accurately to maintain up-to-date inventory records.

▎Key Features:

• Inventory Tracking: Keep track of stock levels in real-time.

• Transaction Management: Record different types of transactions (purchases, sales, transfers, adjustments).

• Location Management: Manage multiple storage locations (warehouses, retail stores).

• Reporting: Generate reports for inventory status and transaction history.

• User Interface: Provide an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.

▎Structure and Implementation Steps:

▎1. Define Inventory Transactions

   • Identify and describe each type of inventory transaction:

     • Purchase Orders: Log incoming products from suppliers.

     • Sales Orders: Record products sold to customers.

     • Stock Transfers: Track movements between different locations.

     • Stock Adjustments: Manage discrepancies due to damage or loss.

▎2. Create Data Models

   • Develop data structures (tables or classes) for the following entities:

     • Product: Attributes include product ID, name, category, unit price, etc.

     • InventoryTransaction: Attributes include transaction ID, type, product ID, quantity, date/time, source location, destination location (if applicable), reason for adjustment.

     • Location: Represents different storage areas (e.g., warehouses, stores).

     • StockLevel: Tracks current stock quantities at each location.

▎3. Implement Core Functionality

   • Develop functions or methods to handle various transactions:

     • recordPurchaseOrder(productId, quantity): Updates stock levels when new products are received.

     • recordSalesOrder(productId, quantity): Decreases stock levels when products are sold.

     • transferStock(productId, quantity, fromLocation, toLocation): Moves stock between locations and updates records accordingly.

     • adjustStock(productId, quantity, reason): Adjusts stock levels for damages or errors.

▎4. Update Stock Levels

   • Ensure that stock counts are automatically updated after each transaction.

   • Implement checks to prevent negative stock levels unless business rules allow it (e.g., backorders).

▎5. Handle Special Cases

   • Implement features for tracking expiration dates for perishable goods.

   • Allow for bulk updates or adjustments when needed.

   • Ensure proper error handling for invalid transactions (e.g., selling more than available).

▎6. User Interface Design

   • Create a simple user interface that allows users to:

     • Input new transactions (purchase orders, sales orders).

     • View current inventory levels by product and location.

     • Generate reports on sales or inventory status.

   • Use forms and tables to display data clearly.

▎7. Testing and Validation

   • Conduct thorough testing of all functionalities:

     • Simulate various transaction scenarios (receiving stock, making sales, transferring items).

     • Validate that stock levels update correctly after each transaction.

• Test error handling for invalid inputs or operations.
